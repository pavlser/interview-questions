# Smallest Range - Google Interview Question for Software Engineer

You have N lists of sorted integers. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the N lists. 

For example:
```
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24, 26] 
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20] 
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30]
```

The smallest range here would be ```[20, 24]``` as it contains 24 from list 1, 20 from list 2, and 22 from list 3.
