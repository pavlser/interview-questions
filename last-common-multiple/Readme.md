# LCM - Last Common Multiple

You are given two natural numbers A and B. Determine the positive natural number N such that the least common multiple of the numbers A + N and B + N is minimal.

Input: The only line of the input contains two natural numbers: A and B. None of them is exceeding 10^9.

Output: Output the positive natural number N such that LCM(A + N, B + N) is minimal. If there are several values of N which yield the minimum, output the smallest one.
